SpeedLimit is a Leopard preference pane for limiting your network 
bandwidth to one of a couple different speeds -- 768k DSL, Edge, 3G, 
and Dialup.  This is really handy for testing your iPhone app under
normal Edge network conditions in the iPhone Simulator.

h2. Instructions

You should just be able to build the xcodeproj and install the 
resulting build product .prefPane.

h2. Download

The binary is now available on <a href="http://mschrag.github.com">my github page</a>.
